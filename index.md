I am a first year Ph.D. student in information at University of Arizona. My advisor is Peter Jansen. I received my master degree in computer science from University of Michigan and my undergraduate degree in microelectronic engineering from Fudan University.

My research interests are mainly in question answering and understanding how computer models reason knowledge and apply knowledge to answer questions. I am especially interested in multi-modal question answering and the use of virtual simulation environments for question answering model training and benchmarking.

Before I worked in natural language processing, I had research experiences in medical image processing and embedded systems.

Some of my personal interests include reading fictions and history, soccers, and traveling.
